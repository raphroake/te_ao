                        <p> In 2016, Wellington artist Shannon Te Ao (Ngāti Tūwharetoa) was awarded the Walter’s Prize for his work two shoots that stretch far out in which the artist recites waiata to a donkey, a swan, a wallaby, rabbits, chicken and geese. two shoots showed at City Gallery a few months earlier, where it was paired with the work of self-taught artist Susan Te Kahurangi King. Here we present an earlier work of Te Ao’s alongside the exhibition Colin McCahon: On Going Out with the Tide.</p>
                     
                        <p>These pairings respond to the ways Te Ao’s work reaches out to other artists, voices and sites—often in the creation of what art writer Martin Patrick has called ‘chaotic entanglements of past and present, then and now, Pakeha and Māori, bi-cultural nation state and indigenous traditions, belief systems and protocols’. These entanglements are equally at play in the paintings of Colin McCahon, especially its appropriations of Māori culture explored in the exhibition. </p>
                        
                        <p><i>Untitled (McCahon House Studies)</i> is one of a number of projects Te Ao made with filmmaker Iain Frengley that respond to charged historical and geographical sites. In this case, Te Ao occupies the former McCahon family home in Titirangi. This is where McCahon made much of his most important work through the 1950s while, almost unbelievably considering its size and condition, raising a family of four with his wife Ann. While now a Museum with an artist residency attached, Te Ao was not officially invited into the McCahon house as a resident. He enters on his own volition, using the found spaces and objects of the house in the performance of a series of repetitive, ritualised actions that channel various dimensions of McCahon’s life and work. His performance is less about the architecture than the psychological spaces that exist around art and life and the demands of creativity and family—traditionally defined as masculine and feminine. Domestic tensions remain a core theme of Te Ao’s art.</p>
                            
                        
                        <p>Te Ao’s performance both drags aspects of the McCahon mythology out of the house and takes others in. The performance was spurred by the psychogeographical approach of Martin Edmond’s book Dark Night: Walking with Colin McCahon(2011) which reimagines the wanderings of the artist during his disappearance in Sydney on the eve of an exhibition opening in 1984. Like Te Ao’s equally stumbling, chaotic performance, Edmond's journey begins and ends with the darkness that defines McCahon’s painting and symbolises a range of other possibilities.</p>

                        <p>Here Te Ao both walks with and talks back to Colin McCahon. He does so as a Māori artist of a later generation just out of art school and seeking the voice through which to speak—one that both he and McCahon found at least partially in te reo, the landscape and in those ghosts of those who have gone before.</p>
