                        <p>In Two shoots that stretch far outShannon Te Ao recites a pre-colonial Māori waiata in English to various animals, including a donkey, geese, a swan, rabbits and a wallaby. The central theme within the work hinges on a communicative gesture (the recital of a song) that explores an empathetic connection—an intimate relationship—a marriage.</p>
                     
                        <p>The waiata is titled ‘He Waiata Mo Te Moe Punarua’ (The Song of the First Wife) and the author is attributed to Matahira a Ngāti Porou woman who was the wife of Te Kotiri a man of chiefly status. In the waiata, Matahira shares the emotional turmoil and faded intimacy caused by her husband taking on a second wife. The artwork’s title references the pēpeha “E kimi ana i ngākawai i toro ki tawhiti” (Seeking two shoots that stretch far out). Pēpeha are shortsayings or idioms that are poetically and musically crafted to convey proverbial meaning. This pēpeha specially describes the creeping shoots growing from a gourd plant likened to someone “seeking to establish a distant relationship or seeking to rediscover his or her own roots”.</p>
                        
                        <p>The viewer is presented with a series of five video sequences between 2-3 minutes in duration and within each scene Te Ao is pictured reading various versions of the single text to different animals.In each recital, Matahira’s story of loss and pain from being emotionally and physically separated from her companion becomes all the more resonant as the animal audience respond with indifference or imagined compassion. By verbalizing the waiata Te Ao reaches out to connect with theminds of those past, blurs gender association and seeks the companionship of kindred animalia. Reflecting on the making of this work and contemplating this search for connection Te Ao writes:</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class="s-indent">I am ambling with a blind frail housebound Wallaby named Walloo, while sharing a lament by  Matahira  as she reflects on the tension arising from the actions of her polygamous husband. As I recite thoughts of loss and despair and through my voice I imagine Matahira listening to the muffled score of her estrangedspouse and his new lover. Walloo is ushered around the small space of the training barn as he brushes the inside of my legs and feet. I anticipate and simultaneously shadow his movements while he uses my presence to plot his own bearings. Meanwhile, the voice of Matahira observes through the wall, the heavy breathing from the next room.</p>
