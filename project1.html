                        <p> With the sun aglow, I have my pensive moods, is a two channel video installation featuring footage filmed in
                        three separate locations in Aotearoa New Zealand, documenting a dance, a highway and a farm. These
                        visuals also contain a myriad of references that create a convergence between Te Ao’s personal sociogeography, his tīpuna and the imaginings of other artists, directors and musicians from distinct times and places.
                        The title and verse featured in the work quotes from the c.1846 moteatea, He waiata mo te mate
                        ngerengere (Song for a leprous malady) by Te Rohu of Ngāti Tūwharetoa. The waiata was composed by Te
                        Rohu to lament layers of personal and collective trauma such as the demise of her health after contracting leprosy from a potential suitor, a fatal landslide which killed her father Mananui Te Heuheu Tukino II along with over fifty others, and also the turbulent early era of colonial settlement.</p>
                     
                        <p>With the sun aglow, I have my pensive moods grew as response to an imagined dialogue, locating Te Rohu
                        within the context of the 1977 Charles Burnett film, Killer of Sheep. Filmed in 1970s Los Angeles, in the
                        African-American neighbourhood of Watts, Burnett’s film captures a rare moment of intimacy in the life
                        of a slaughterhouse worker, where the protagonist slowly dances with his wife before abruptly resisting her
                            embrace. </p>
                        
                        <p>Te Ao restages the scene to show two women dancing in a small clearing on a commercial hemp farm in New Zealand’s South Island that propagates the plant for health products. In Te Ao’s film the dancing women are surrounded by female plants have been pollinated and dying male hemp plants that have concluded their natural role.</p>
                            
                        
                        <p>This scene is paired with footage shot on a commercial dairy farm which directly encircles the urupa for
                        Te Ao’s whanau who also share their tribal affiliations with Te Rohu. Alongside this, Te Ao presents a
                        sequence captured along the Rangipo Desert, commonly known as the ‘Desert Road’, a stretch of highway
                        located near the boundaries of Te Ao’s tribal lands. Known for its iconic barren landscape situated at the
                        foot of the region’s most notable volcanic peaks, the area is predominantly occupied as a training facility
                            for the New Zealand defence force.</p>

                        <p>The amalgamation of these various references conflates the narratives and places beyond their original
                        personal and socio-political contexts. By doing so Te Ao creates an enigmatic work that seeks out
                        empathetic registers within the human condition such as the tenuous nature of relationships,
                        communication, wellbeing and a sense of place or tūrangawaewae.</p>
